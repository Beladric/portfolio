  <h1>Kilian GOÃ‹TZ portfolio</h1>
</div>
<p>
  Greetings and welcome in portfolio repository. Purpose of this repository is to hold the source code of my portfolio.
</p>
<p>
  Portfolio was made using HTML5, SASS compile in CSS3 and Javascript. It's an old way to code website compare to modern Javascript frameworks and libraries (ReactJs, VueJs, etc.), nonetheless I choose this way because I want to highlight my integration skills. Moreover, this ay is very lighter compare modern website which use Javascript. It's a static website (there are no backend) hosted with GitHub pages. 
</p>
<h2>
  SASS
</h2>
<p>
  For a plethora of reasons, I choose to use SASS. Mainly reason is SASS syntax easier to read than CSS (no semicolon and no brace). This is really pleasant when you write huge number of lines.
