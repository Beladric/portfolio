# Portfolio repository

Hi !

Welcome in portfolio repository. the aim of this repository is to hold the source code of my personal portfolio.

I made my portfolio using HTML, SASS compile to CSS and JS. I know it's an old way to code a website but in light of size of website and skill that I want to expose, it was the greatest way (In my opinion). Compare to modern javascript frameworks as React, Vue or Angular, using HTML, CSS and JS is lighter. Moreover, SEO is more simple on this type of website.

## SASS

I made the choice to use SASS for a plethora of reasons. Mainly reason is SASS syntax easier to read than CSS. that is really pleasant when you write a lot of lines.
