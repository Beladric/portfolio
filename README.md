# Portfiolio repository

Hi !

Welcome in portfolio repository. the aim of this repository is to hold the source code of my personnal portfolio.

I made my portfolio using HTML, SASS compile to CSS and JS.

## SASS

I made the choice to use SASS fore a plethora of reasons. Mainly reason is SASS syntax easier to read than CSS. that is really pleasant when you write lot of lines.
